# Time-Frequency-Analysis-of-EEG-Signals-Using-Continuous-Wavelet-Transform-CWT-
EEG Timeâ€“Frequency Analysis using Wavelet Transform. This project analyzes motor cortex EEG signals (C3 &amp; C4) from PhysioNet, computing band power, coherence, and phase locking value (PLV) to study neural dynamics during rest and movement, implemented fully in R.
